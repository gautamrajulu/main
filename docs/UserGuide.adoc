== Introduction
Welcome to NoteNote (NN)!

If you're looking for an application to organize your projects you've come to the right place! But that's not all NoteNote can do! NoteNote can also keep track of individual tasks, analyze your productivity and share your To-Do list with your friends!

We designed the application ground up for computing students, so you can say that NoteNote is designed for computing students, by computing students, so you can be sure that it will fulfil all your project management needs!

Built for computing students, NoteNote uses minimal (GUI) elements, instead opting for a faster Command Line Interface (CLI) while maintaining the benefits of the GUI. So if you can type fast and are used to command line, NoteNote is sure to help manage your task faster than other traditional GUI based task managers.

So just head over to our <<Quick Start>> section and begin your NoteNote experience!

== How to use this guide

There are several terms which we use throughout our guide. To make your life easier, please do read the following section to ensure that you are able to use our User Guide to the fullest extent!

=== Commands Format

The examples in this guide are formatted using the following convention:
Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME, NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Sample Task 1 t/SAMPLE` or as `n/Sample Task 1`.
* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as (i.e. 0 times), `t/CS2101`, `t/SEM1` `t/SCHOOL` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME` `ds/DESCRIPTION`, `ds/DESCRIPTION` `n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* The `add`, `edit` and `delete` commands each have a shorthand equivalent alias, and their usage can be viewed below at their respective sections in the User Guide.


== Application Overview

=== Application Layout

image::apporg.png[width="790"]

The application has two layers, the project layer and the task layer, as shown in Figure 1 above. There are some commands which work differently based on the layer they are in. This is covered in detail in Sections 6 and 7. The project layer contains all the projects the user has added while the task layer contains the tasks and subtasks assigned to a particular project.

=== User Interface Layout

image::applayout.png[width="790"]

* *Panel A: Command Box* - Where your commands will be typed
* *Panel B: Results Box* - Displays result for the following commands: history, taskhistory, compare,  listtag; else displays either success / error message for all other commands.
* *Panel C: Project Box* - Displays list of project
* *Panel D: Task Box* - Displays list of tasks for a selected project
* *Panel E: Description Box* - Displays long description for a selected task

Panel *A*, *C*, *D* are user-interactable while panels *B*, *E* are non-interactable.

Panel A will always be active, allowing you to input your commands at any time.

Upon first opening of the application, your active panel will start from *C*, and only upon choosing a project will your active panel change to *D*.


== Quick Start


.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `notenote.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
.  Type the command in the command box or *Panel A* (refer to Figure 2) and press Enter to execute it.
.  Some example commands you can try:
* *`listproject`* : lists all projects
* **`select 1`** : selects the project at index 1
* **`add n/Do research on Singapore history dl/1-1-2020`** : adds a task of title “Do research on Singapore History” with a deadline set at “1st January 2020” to the project previously selected.

* *`delete 1`* : deletes the task being shown at index 1


== Project Level Features

=== Navigating Between Projects
When selecting a (different) project to the view tasks of the project, always follow the 2 steps below:

. `listproject`: List all project in project list
. `select INDEX`: Select a project to view all the tasks within selected project

=== Project Level Commands

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another computer? +
*A*: Data can be transferred between computers by simply porting over the *_projectlist.json_* file located at the *_data_* folder. Alternatively, you could:
