== Introduction
Welcome to NoteNote (NN)!

If you're looking for an application to organize your projects you've come to the right place! But that's not all NoteNote can do! NoteNote can also keep track of individual tasks, analyze your productivity and share your To-Do list with your friends!

We designed the application ground up for computing students, so you can say that NoteNote is designed for computing students, by computing students, so you can be sure that it will fulfil all your project management needs!

Built for computing students, NoteNote uses minimal (GUI) elements, instead opting for a faster Command Line Interface (CLI) while maintaining the benefits of the GUI. So if you can type fast and are used to command line, NoteNote is sure to help manage your task faster than other traditional GUI based task managers.

== How to use this guide

There are several terms which we use throughout our guide. To make your life easier, please do read the following section to ensure that you are able to use our Developer Guide to the fullest extent!

=== Icons Meaning

Various icons are also used throughout this user guide with the following context:

[TIP]
This is a tip. Follow these suggested tips to make your life much simpler when using *NoteNote*!

[NOTE]
This is a note. These are things for you to take note of when using *NoteNote*.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`*
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.
. Open link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow.java`] and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=...' to module compiler options` for each error
. Repeat this for the test folder as well (e.g. check link:{repoURL}/src/test/java/seedu/address/ui/HelpWindowTest.java[`HelpWindowTest.java`] for code errors, and if so, resolve it the same way)

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.project.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::SDforDeleteTask.png[width="800"]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `ProjectParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteTaskSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Project List Data and Project Data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.projectbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedProject`.
It extends `Project` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `projectStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedProject#commit()` -- Saves the current project state in its history.
* `VersionedProject#undo()` -- Restores the previous project state from its history.
* `VersionedProject#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone project state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitProject()`, `Model#undoProject()` and `Model#redoProject()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedProject` will be initialized with the initial project state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single project state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th task in the project. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitProject()`, causing the modified state of the project after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `projectStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted project state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David ...` to add a new task. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitProject()`, causing another modified project state to be saved into the `projectStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitProject()`, so the project state will not be saved into the `projectStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the task was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoProject()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous project state, and restores the project to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial project state, then there are no previous project states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoProject()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoProject()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the project to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `projectStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest project state, then there are no undone project states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoProject()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the project, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitProject()`, `Model#undoProject()` or `Model#redoProject()`. Thus, the `projectStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitProject()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `projectStateList`, all project states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire project.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the task being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of project states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedProject`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::importexport[]
=== Import/Export feature

The import and export feature was implemented in order to facilitate easy transfer of projects and tasks between two NoteNote users.

==== Current Implementation

The `import` feature reads projects from a JSON file provided as input and adds these projects on top of the current list of projects.
The mechanism is facilitated by `JsonUtil` and is achieved using the following functions:

* `JsonUtil#readJsonFile()` -- Read projects from JSON file
* `VersionedProjectList#addProject()` -- Adds projects from JSON file to project list.

The `export` feature exports the current selected project (after `select` 1) or projects specified by their index to a JSON file.
The mechanism is facilitated by `FileUtil` and `JsonUtil` and is achieved using the following functions:

* `FileUtil#createIfMissing()` -- Creates JSON file to write to if it does not exist
* `JsonUtil#saveJsonFile()` -- Writes projects to JSON file

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the import/export mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application, `projectList` will be populated by invoking `StorageManager#readProjectList`.

[NOTE]
If user launches the application for the first time, `projectList` will be populated with sample project list as *_./data/projectlist.json_* does not exist.

Step 2. The user executes `import ./data/import.json` to add projects from JSON file to `versionedProjectList`.

.. Path to JSON file is passed to `JsonUtil#readJsonFile()` which would read projects to a temporary project list.

.. Application will then loop through all projects and add them to `versionedProjectList` using `VersionedProjectList#addProject()`.

.. `updateFilteredProjectList` is then executed to refresh `ProjectListPanel` with all projects, including recently imported projects.

The following sequence diagram shows how the import operation works:

.Sequence Diagram for `import` Command
image::ImportUML.png[width="650"]

Step 3. The user executes `export i/1,2,3 o/./data/export.json` to export projects with index 1, 2 and 3.

.. Application will `get` the projects from `filteredProjectList` and add them to a new ProjectList `projectsToExport`.

.. `projectsToExport` is then passed to `JsonUtil#saveJsonFile()` which would write to output file specified by user.

[NOTE]
The entire project list could be found in *_./data/projectlist.json_*

The following sequence diagram shows how the export operation works:

.Sequence Diagram for `export` Command
image::ExportUML.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

We considered two designs for the format to import and export multiple projects and tasks within the project list.

|===
| |Alternative one|Alternative two
|*Consideration*
|Each project will have its own *_<Project File>.json_* which contains only that project's tasks.
|All projects and all tasks to be contained in a single *_project.json_* file.

|*Pros*
|Easy to implement.
|Will not clutter data folder.

|*Cons*
|May clutter data folder with too many project files. Application will have to read a new project file whenever user switches project.
|Storage model has to be modified to support new storage structure.

|*Current Choice*
|
|This option was chosen as users need not handle multiple files when importing and exporting projects.
|===
// end::importexport[]

// tag::compare[]
=== Compare Task feature

The Compare Task feature allows the user to compare the past iteration of a task before it was edited.

==== Current Implementation

Building on top of the Undo/Redo feature, it is facilitated by `VersionedProject` and implements the following operations:

* `VersionedProject#compareTask()` -- Compares the chosen task with its previous version if it exist.

image::compareseq.png[width="650", title="Sequence Diagram for `compare` Command"]

Given above (Figure 10) is the sequence diagram when `compare` is called.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#compareTask()`.

image::compare1.png[width="650", title="Example of VersionedProject when `edit` on Task B"]

Given above (Figure 11.) is an example usage scenario and how the Compare Task mechanism behaves.


Step 1. The user selects the task to compare by entering the index of the task that is shown. `CompareCommandParser#CompareCommand()` will then get the index of the task
within `projectStateList` and passed into `CompareCommand#CommandResult()`.

Step 2. The index will then be used by `CompareCommand#CommandResult()` to retrieved the Task object within `projectStateList` and passed into `VersionedProject#compareTask()`.

Step 3. `VersionedProject#compareTask()` will retrieve the unique `taskId` of the chosen task.

image::compare2.png[width="650", title="Process of how `compare` command will flow"]

Step 4. `VersionedProject#compareTask()` will iterate through all the the tasks within each project state. The `taskId`
will be used to determine if the task encountered during the iteration is the same as the chosen task (Figure 12, A).

[NOTE]
If no same tasks are found after iterating through all the project states, or if there is no difference in all the task
that is encountered, "Nothing to compare" will be showed to the user.

Step 5. If the task encountered is the same as the chosen task, the 2 task will be compared against their name, description & deadline (Figure 12, B).

image::compare 3.png[width="400", title="A successful `compare` where name is different"]

Step 6. If there is a difference in any of the fields in the comparison (Figure 13), the difference will be showed to the user.
Else Step 4. will continue to run to look for another version of the chosen task to compare (Figure 12, C).

==== Design Considerations
Two designs was considered for the implementation of `compare`. The pros and cons of the designs are listed in the table below
and our *chosen option is Alternative 1*
|===
| |Alternative 1 | Alternative 2
|Design
|Utilise existing versionedProject to look for the specific task in previous versions.
|All tasks will have their own "versionedTask", keeping track of its own history per task.

|Pros
|Easy to implement.
|System performance will be better as you will iterate through lesser data.

|Cons
|A large versionedProject might result in a slow system performance.
|Harder to implement, can be considered for future version in v2.0

|Implementation Choice
|*Implemented*
|
|===
// end::compare[]

// tag::list[]
=== List Feature
==== Current Implementation

Step 1: User uses list feature in task level to list all tasks and in project level to list all projects

Step 2: List checks if the program is in the task level or project level by `LogicManager#getState()`

Step 3:

* If the program is in the project level, it updates the `Model#filteredProjectList` using
`Model#updateFilteredProjectList` and the predicate `Model#PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PROJECTS`.

* If the program is in the task level, it updates the `Model#filteredTaskList` using the `Model#updateFilteredTaskList`
and the predicate `Model#PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_TASKS`.

This results in the relavent panels updating to show all tasks (if entered in the task level)
or all projects (if entered in the project level)

image::sequenceDiagramList.png[width="800", title="Sequence Diagram for `list` Command"]

==== Design Considerations
|===
| |Alternative 1
|Design
|Command which check which level it is currently on and lists projects or tasks based on it.

|Pros
|No need for two separate functions for listing tasks or listing projects

|Cons
|Implementation is more prone to bugs and harder to debug
|===
// end::list[]

// tag::listprojects[]
=== List Projects Feature
==== Current Implementation

Step 1: User uses listproject to navigate from the task level to the project level

Step 2: Uses `LogicManager#setState()` to set display the project level

Step 3: Syncs versionedProject with versionedProjectList using

This results in the relavent panels updating to show all projects and hiding the task panel

==== Design Considerations
|===
| |Alternative 1
|Design
|Changes `LogicManager` state and hides the task panel

|Pros
|Easy to implement

|Cons
|Simple command with no cons
|===
// end::listprojects[]

// tag::sortDeadline[]
=== SortDeadline Feature
==== Current Implementation

Step 1: Sort command should be done in the task level to ensure this,
`LogicManager.getState()` is executed and user is asked to move to task level if command was entered in the project level.

Step 2: The list of tasks is obtained via `Model#getFilteredTaskLIst() and stored in a observable list `filteredTasks`

Step 3: `filteredTasks` is sorted via the provided comparator and stored as a sorted list `sortedList`

Step 4: The list of tasks in `Model` is cleared using `Model#clearTasks()`

Step 5: The list of tasks are entered individually into model from the `sortedList` by using a loop and the
`Model#addTask()`

image::sequenceDiagramSortDeadline.png[width="800", title="Sequence Diagram for `sortDeadline` Command"]

==== Design Considerations
Two designs was considered for the implementation of `sortDeadline`.
The pros and cons of the designs are listed in the table below and our chosen option is Alternative 1
|===
| |Alternative 1| Alternative 2
|Design
|Sort would be permanent
|Sort would be temporary

|Pros
|User would have to use sort function less often
|Would impact other functions lesser

|Cons
|Harder to implement as it would affect other functions
|Less user friendly

|===
// end::sortDeadline[]

// tag::listtag[]
=== List Tag feature
The `listtag` feature allows users to list all unique tags and associated tasks within a project.
It requires users to navigate to a project first with `select` command before executing the `listtag` command. Failure to do so would trigger an error message prompting users to do so.

==== Current Implementation
Step 1. The user launches the application. `projectList` will be populated by invoking `StorageManager#readProjectList`.

Step 2. The user selects a project. `setProject()` is invoked based on `Model#filteredProjectList`, and the tasks for that project are displayed via invoking `Model#filteredTaskList`.

Step 3: User displays all tags and their associated tasks in the project by entering `listtag` and the following operations are carried out:

* `ListTagCommand` calls `Model#getTagWithTaskList()` who in turns calls `Model#getUniqueTagList()`
* `Model#getUniqueTagList()` makes use of the list of tasks obtained from `filteredTask` to iterate through all tasks and returns a list of unique tags within each project state
* `Model#getTagWithTaskList()` uses a nested loop to iterate through this list of unique tags and the list of tasks to concatenate all tasks with the same tags into a string
* This string is returned to `ListTagCommand` and displayed to `CommandResult`

The following sequence diagram shows how the List Tag operation works:

image::ListTagSequenceDiagram.png[width="600", title="Sequence Diagram for `listtag` Command"]

==== Design Considerations
Two designs was considered for the implementation of `listtag`. The pros and cons of the designs are listed in the table below
and our *chosen option is Alternative 1*
|===
| |Alternative 1 | Alternative 2
|Design
|Seperate parsing and cleaning of `filteredTask` to obtain the string of tags with their associated task to be done at `Model`
|Parsing and cleaning of `filteredTask` to obtain the string of tags with their associated task to be done directly at `ListTagCommand`

|Pros
|Functions are reusable since they are located `Model`
|Easy to implement.

|Cons
|A large `Model` might result in a slow system performance.
|`ListTagCommand` will be cluttered and many of its functions will not be reusable.
|===


// end::listtag[]

// tag::definetag[]
=== Define Tag feature
The `definetag` feature allows users to create a group tag and add multiple child tags into it. It should be used in conjunction with `addtag` feature.

==== Current Implementation
`definetag` feature can be used on both `project` and `task` level. Duplicated group tags created from `definetag` command are not allowed.

Step 1. The user launches the application. `projectList` will be populated by invoking `StorageManager#readProjectList`.

Step 2: User creates a new group tag and its associated child tags with `definetag`.

Step 3: `DefineTagCommandParser` create a new `GroupTag` object from the user's input. The object contains the group tag’s name and its associated tags and are return to `DefineTagCommand`.

Step 4: `DefineTagCommand` checks if the returned `GroupTag` is unique via `Model#hasGroupTag()` and adds the object to the model with `Model#addGroupTag()` and `Model#commitProjectList` if it is.

The following sequence diagram shows how the Define Tag operation works:

image::DefineTagSequenceDiagram.png[width="600", title="Sequence Diagram for `definetag` Command"]

==== Design Considerations
Two designs was considered for the implementation of `definetag`. The pros and cons of the designs are listed in the table below and our *chosen option is Alternative 1*
|===
| |Alternative 1 | Alternative 2
|Design
|Redefine group tag and its associated child tags every instances of `NoteNote`.
|Saves the group tags and its associated child tags created via `DefineTagCommand` into storage

|Pros
|Easy to implement
|Better user experience since group tags established in previous instances of `NoteNote` can still be reused.

|Cons
|All group tags created in `DefineTagCommand` will be lost once the instance of `NoteNote` is closed.
|Harder to implement, can be considered for future version in v2.0
|===
// end::definetag[]

// tag::addtag[]
=== Add Tag feature
The `addtag` feature allows users to apply existing group tag to multiple tasks. It should be used in conjunction with `definetag` feature. It requires users to do the following:

* Navigate to a project first with `select` command before executing the `addtag` command
* Add only an existing group tag defined previously at `definetag`

Failure to do any of the above would trigger an error message prompting users to do so.

==== Current Implementation
The `addTag` feature obtains the target task from `FilteredTaskList` based on the task index given by the user. It then adds the child tags associated to the group tag defined previously at `definetag` into the task.

Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedProject#commit()` — Saves the current project state in its history
* `VersionedProjectList#commit()` — Saves the current project list state in its history

These operations are exposed in the Model interface as `Model#commitProject()` and `Model#commitProjectList()` respectively.

Step 1. The user launches the application. `projectList` will be populated by invoking `StorageManager#readProjectList`.

Step 2. The user selects a project. `setProject()` is invoked based on `Model#filteredProjectList`, and the tasks for that project are displayed via invoking `Model#filteredTaskList`.

Step 3: User applies the group tag and its associated child tags in the selected task by entering `addtag`. The following operations are carried out:

* `AddTagCommandParser` parses the arguments and return them `AddTagCommand#AddTagCommand()`
* `lastShownList` of all tasks in the current project is obtained from `Model` using `getFilteredTaskList()`
* Two identical tasks, `targetTask` and `taskToAdd` are created based on `lastShownList` using the index from user's input.
* `AddTagCommand` will then call `Model#getGroupTagList` which returns a list of all group tags. Names from the list of group tags will be iterated and checked if it matches the name given by user's input.
* Tags in the group tag will be added `taskToAdd` if the checks passes.

The following sequence diagram shows how the Add Tag operation works:

==== Design Considerations
Two designs was considered for the implementation of `definetag`. The pros and cons of the designs are listed in the table below
and our *chosen option is Alternative 1*
|===
| |Alternative 1 | Alternative 2
|Design
|Tags in group tag are added to the task by a separate command and remain visible in Task List
|Users can add a group tag into a task via the existing `add` and `edit` command with `gt/GROUPTAG` as a parameter

|Pros
|Easy to implement
|Better user experience by utilizing existing command that users are already familiar with.

|Cons
|Might be confusing to users since tags are usually added via `add` or `edit` commands
|Harder to implement, can be considered for future version in v2.0
|===
// end::addtag[]

// tag::taskhistory[]
=== View Task Command History Feature

Allows the user to view a list of all the command history of a chosen task.

==== Current Implementation

Stores a parallel list `userInputHistoryTaskId` along `userInputHistory`, containing the taskId of `edit`/`completed`/`addtag`/`delete` commands.
The list will store `0` for all other commands.

image::taskhistoryseq.png[width="650", title="Sequence Diagram for `taskhistory` Command"]

Given above (Figure 17) is the sequence diagram when `taskhistory` is called.

It is facilitated by `CommandHistory` and implements the following operations:

* `CommandHistory#addHistoryTaskId()` -- Adds taskId to the index that is the same as the `edit`/`completed`/`addtag`/`delete` command. Pads `0` for all other commands.

Step 1. When `taskhistory` is executed, `CommandHistory#getHistory()`, `CommandHistory#getHistoryTaskId()` and `Task#getTaskId()` is called.
Retrieving a list of `userInputHistory`, a list of `userInputHistoryTaskId` and the taskID of a task, `taskId`

Step 2. `userInputHistoryTaskId` will be iterated through.

* Step 2a. If `taskId` of the selected task appears within `userInputHistoryTaskId`, the index at that position will be used
to retrieve the command string within `userInputHistory`. The string will then be appended to a ArrayList<string>, `commandlist`.

Step 3. If `commandList` is not empty, it will be printed in reverse order(newest command first, oldest command last) to the user.

==== Behaviour when commands are executed

image::ViewTaskHistorySeq1.png[width="650", title="Behaviour of userTaskHistoryTaskId during `add` commands"]

Note the behaviour of useTaskHistoryTaskId when all other commands (*not* `edit`/`completed`/`addtag`/`delete`) is called (Figure 18). `CommandHistory#addHistoryTaskId()` will not be called thus `userInputHistoryTaskId` will not be updated.
However `userInputHistory` will still be updated as usual.

image::ViewTaskHistorySeq2.png[width="650", title="Behaviour of userTaskHistoryTaskId during `edit` commands"]

Note the behaviour when a `edit` command  is called (Figure 19). `CommandHistory#addHistoryTaskId()` will be called thus `userInputHistoryTaskId` will be updated with the taskId of the task where the
`edit` command is called on. Observe that positions of previous non-`edit` command will be filled with `0`. `userInputHistory` will still be updated as usual.

==== Design Considerations
Two designs was considered for the implementation of `taskhistory`. The pros and cons of the designs are listed in the table below
and our *chosen option is Alternative 1*
|===
| |Alternative 1 | Alternative 2
|Design
|Implement a separate list `userInputHistoryTaskId` alongside `userInputHistory` to contain taskId of task where `edit` is called on.
|All tasks will have their own `userInputHistoryTaskId`, keeping track of its own edit history.

|Pros
|Easy to implement.
|System performance will be better as you will iterate through lesser data, will have less wastage of space.

|Cons
|A large `userInputHistoryTaskId` might result in a slower system performance during search and contains wasted space as well.
|Harder to implement, can be considered for future version in v2.0.

=== Completed/Analyse feature

The `completed` feature allows for tasks to be marked as completed. +
The `analyse` feature allows for viewing of statistics for each project, including:

* Number of tasks completed for each project
* Percentage of each project completed

==== Current Implementation
The `completed` feature obtains the target task from `FilteredTaskList` based on the task index given by the user, and adds a `completed` tag to it. +
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedProject#commit()` — Saves the current project state in its history
* `VersionedProjectList#commit()` — Saves the current project list state in its history

These operations are exposed in the Model interface as `Model#commitProject()` and `Model#commitProjectList()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the completed/analyse mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. `projectList` will be populated by invoking `StorageManager#readProjectList`.


Step 2. The user selects a project. `setProject()` is invoked based on `filteredProjectList`, and the tasks for that project are displayed via invoking `filteredTaskList`.

Step 3. The user marks a task as completed by entering `completed` followed by the index of the task.

.. `lastShownList` of all tasks in the current project is obtained from `Model` using `getFilteredTaskList()`.
.. Two identical tasks, `targetTask` and `taskToComplete`, are created based on `lastShownList` using the index from user input.
.. Tags of `taskToComplete` are obtained using `getTags()` and checked if they contain a `completed` tag. If it does not, this indicates that the task has not been completed yet, and a `completed` tag will be added.

The following sequence diagram shows how the completed operation works:

image::Completed.png[width="800", title="Sequence Diagram for `completed` Command"]]

{blank} +

Step 4. The user goes back to project level using `listproject`. `setProject` is invoked to sync `VersionedProject` with `VersionedProjectList`.

Step 5. The user enters `analyse` to view statistics of all the projects.

.. `filteredProjects` is obtained from `getFilteredProjectList()`.
.. For each project in `filteredProjects`, `filteredTasks` is obtained from `getTaskList()`.
.. For each task in `filteredTasks`, `getTags()` is invoked to check if the task has a `completed` tag.
.. The result returned is the number of tasks completed in each project, and the percentage of each project completed.

The following sequence diagram shows how the analyse operation works:

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementation of `completed` feature

Two designs were considered for the implementation of `completed`. The pros and cons of the designs are listed in the table below
and our *chosen option is Alternative 1*.
|===
| |Alternative 1 | Alternative 2
|Design
|`completed` tag added to task, which remains visible in Task List.
|Task saved to Storage and removed from display in Task List.

|Pros
|Adding a specific tag to the existing task can be done using existing `addTag()`.
|`DeleteCommand` can be used to delete task from Task List.

|Cons
|Completed task needed to be updated in Task List and Project List.
|Storage needs to keep track of all the completed tasks and be able to separate them based on the projects they were under.

|Implementation Choice
|*Implemented* +
This option allows for the user to still be able to view which tasks have been completed, which helps to gauge their own progress.
|
|===

{blank} +

Two designs were considered for the implementation of `analyse`. The pros and cons of the designs are listed in the table below
and our *chosen option is Alternative 2*.
|===
| |Alternative 1 | Alternative 2
|Design
|`analyse` can only display statistics for one project at a time.
|`analyse` can display statistics for all project at one go.

|Pros
|Easier as only need to iterate through one project's tasks.
|User can easily view progress on all projects with one command.

|Cons
|User will need to select each project and call `analyse` separately.
|More complicated as need to iterate through all tasks in all projects.

|Implementation Choice
|
|*Implemented* +
User will experience greater convenience and ease of use if one command can display statistics across all projects.
|===
// end::completedanalyse[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

.Saving documentation as PDF files in Chrome
image::chrome_save_as_pdf.png[width="300"]

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.
|_not set_

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.
This will cause the associated item in the navigation bar to be highlighted.
One of: `UserGuide`, `DeveloperGuide`, ``LearningOutcomes``{asterisk}, `AboutUs`, `ContactUs`

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_
|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.
====

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.project.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.project.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.project.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.project.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/project/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson library] for JSON parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives:

[loweralpha]
. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size)
. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

== Product Scope

*Target user profile*:

* COM Students who need to manage multiple projects simultaneously
* Prefers typing over mouse input
* Is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

*Value proposition*: Manage multiple projects and to manage the individual tasks within a project
